## Brief Introduction

I am a determined and ready-to-learn student and developer with a strong interest in tech stacks like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Web Developement. I am proficient in Python and R, which are the languages I use in most of my projects, and HTML/CSS scripting languages. At the moment, I am looking into ML/AI (Data Science), React (Web Dev) and Data Structures and Algorithms. I aspire to be a ML/AI Engineer and provide solutions to real-world problems using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
